# Forecasting NHS Patients No Longer Meeting Criteria to Reside

Forecasting the number of patients remaining in NHS hospitals who no longer meet the criteria to reside, using AI models.

## Project Overview

This project applies AI-driven time series forecasting to predict the number of patients in NHS hospitals in England who remain in care despite no longer meeting the clinical criteria to reside. These cases often represent delayed discharges, which have significant implications for hospital capacity, operational efficiency, and patient well-being.

By forecasting these trends, healthcare professionals and planners can better anticipate system pressure, improve discharge processes, and optimize resource allocation.

## Objectives

- Predict future counts of patients not meeting criteria to reside using time series models
- Support NHS decision-making with data-driven insights
- Enable reproducibility and transparency using public data

## ðŸ› Methods and Tools

- **AI Models:** Prophet (with potential extensions to other ML models)
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, Prophet, scikit-learn
- **Data Source:** NHS England â€“ [Daily Discharge Situation Reports](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/discharge-delays/)

## Outputs

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Forecast plots with confidence intervals
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE)
- Automated and reproducible notebook
